1
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:08,446
Help! Help!

2
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:13,040
Hey, pea brain!

3
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:27,328
Help!

4
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:49,787
Do something!

5
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:54,358
- What?
- Anything!

6
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,028
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

7
00:00:57,029 --> 00:01:01,793
Wingardium Leviosa.

8
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:14,766
Cool.

9
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:39,704
Is it dead?

10
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:46,141
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

11
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:54,685
Troll boogers.

12
00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:58,489
Oh, my goodness! Explain yourselves,
both of you!

13
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:05,296
- Well, what it is--
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

14
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:07,365
Miss Granger?

15
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:12,670
I went looking for the troll. I
thought I could handle it.

16
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:14,772
But I was wrong.

17
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:18,356
If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found

18
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:20,745
me, I'd probably be dead.

19
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:25,449
Be that as it may, it was an extremely
foolish thing to do.

20
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,761
I expected more rational behavior and

21
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:31,288
am very disappointed in you.

22
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:34,525
Five points will be taken from
Gryffindor...

23
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:38,562
...for your serious lack of judgment.

24
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:40,765
As for you two gentlemen...

25
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:44,402
...I just hope you realize how
fortunate you are.

26
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:48,039
Not many first-year students could
take on a troll...

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,875
...and live to tell the tale.

28
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:54,712
Five points...

29
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:59,417
...will be awarded to each of you...

30
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:04,944
...for sheer dumb luck.

31
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:14,290
Perhaps you ought to go. It might wake
up.

32
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:22,658
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

33
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,095
Ron's right. You'll need your strength
today.

34
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:28,864
I'm not hungry.

35
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:32,348
Good luck today, Potter. You've proven

36
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,671
yourself against a troll.

37
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:38,107
A game of Quidditch should be easy
work.

38
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:43,668
Even if it is against Slytherin.

39
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,755
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

40
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:55,318
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let the

41
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,093
troll in as a diversion...

42
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,895
...so he could get past that dog.

43
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:02,898
But he got bit, that's why he's
limping.

44
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:05,835
But why would anyone go near that dog?

45
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:09,271
At Gringotts, Hagrid took something
out of the vault.

46
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:12,742
Said it was Hogwarts business, very
secret.

47
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:14,110
You're saying--

48
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:21,048
That's what the dog's guarding. That's
what Snape wants.

49
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:36,198
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

50
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,257
Let's open it.

51
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,979
It's a broomstick.

52
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,584
That's not just a broomstick, it's a
Nimbus 2000!

53
00:04:55,585 --> 00:05:00,144
But who--?

54
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:22,011
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

55
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:25,881
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

56
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:29,685
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

57
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:32,521
I took a Bludger to the head two
minutes in.

58
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:37,889
Woke up in hospital a week later.

59
00:05:57,547 --> 00:06:01,150
Welcome to Hogwarts'first Quidditch
game of the season.

60
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:08,315
Today's game, Slytherin versus
Gryffindor!

61
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:38,787
The players take their positions...

62
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:42,791
...as Madam Hooch steps onto the field
to begin the game!

63
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:46,729
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

64
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,698
...from all of you!

65
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:57,439
The Bludgers are up, followed by the
Golden Snitch.

66
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,376
Remember, the Snitch is worth 150
points.

67
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:06,677
The Seeker who catches the Snitch ends
the game.

68
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:17,314
The Quaffle is released and the game
begins!

69
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:40,376
Angelina Johnson scores! Ten points
for Gryffindor!

70
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:46,883
Well done!

71
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:53,243
Slytherin takes the Quaffle. Bletchley

72
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:56,924
passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

73
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:31,829
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

74
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:47,478
Give me that!

75
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:21,540
Take that side!

76
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:14,262
What's going on with Harry's
broomstick?

77
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,145
It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom!

78
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:30,015
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

79
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:53,262
Come on, Hermione!

80
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:11,152
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

81
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:21,258
Fire! You're on fire!

82
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:41,280
Go, go, go, go!

83
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:34,243
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

84
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:35,944
He's got the Snitch!

85
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:40,182
Harry Potter receives 150 points for
catching the Snitch!

86
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:44,378
Gryffindor wins!

87
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:29,932
Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse
on Harry's broom?

88
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,259
Who knows? Why was he trying to get

89
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,069
past that three-headed dog?

90
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,672
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

91
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:38,221
- That thing has a name?

92
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:40,575
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

93
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:43,662
I bought him off an Irishman. I lent

94
00:13:43,663 --> 00:13:46,081
him to Dumbledore to guard--

95
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:48,829
Shouldn't have said that. No more

96
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,253
questions! That's top-secret.

97
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:55,457
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

98
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:59,428
Codswallop. Professor Snape is a
Hogwarts teacher.

99
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,189
Teacher or not, I know a spell when I

100
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,733
see one. I've read all about them.

101
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:08,537
You've got to keep eye contact, and
Snape wasn't blinking.

102
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:11,440
Exactly.

103
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:14,409
Now, you listen to me, all three of
you.

104
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,796
You're meddling in things that ought

105
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:19,247
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

106
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:22,092
What that dog is guarding is between

107
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:24,553
Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

108
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:26,989
Nicholas Flamel?

109
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,860
I shouldn't have said that. I should
not have said that.

110
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:36,231
Nicholas Flamel. Who's Nicholas
Flamel?

111
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:40,700
I don't know.

112
00:14:57,053 --> 00:15:00,088
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas

113
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:03,125
Ring the Hogwart bell

114
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:06,094
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas

115
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:11,564
Cast a Christmas spell

116
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:28,511
Knight to E-5.

117
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:38,350
Queen to E-5.

118
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:43,498
That's totally barbaric!

119
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:47,269
That's wizard's chess. I see you've
packed.

120
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,071
I see you haven't.

121
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:51,720
Change of plans. My parents went to

122
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:54,443
Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

123
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:58,447
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

124
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:02,084
He's going to the library to look up
Nicholas Flamel.

125
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:06,221
We've looked a hundred times!

126
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:13,695
Not in the restricted section. Happy
Christmas.

127
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:19,097
I think we've had a bad influence on
her.

128
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:25,971
Harry, wake up! Come on, Harry, wake
up!

129
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:36,852
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

130
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:39,688
What are you wearing?

131
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:44,493
Oh, my mum made it. Looks like you've
got one too.

132
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:49,428
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

133
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:58,930
There they are.

134
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,153
"Your father left this in my
possession before he died.

135
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:17,784
It is time it was returned to you. Use
it well."

136
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:36,144
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

137
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:41,580
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

138
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:45,954
My body's gone!

139
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:50,091
I know what that is. That's an
invisibility cloak!

140
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:52,494
I'm invisible?

141
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:57,332
They're really rare. I wonder who gave
it to you.

142
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:04,668
There was no name. It just said, "Use
it well."

143
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:36,304
Famous Fire-Eaters. Fifteenth-Century
Fiends.

144
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:44,607
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel. Where are
you?

145
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:05,362
Who's there?

146
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:17,137
I know you're in there. You can't
hide.

147
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:28,248
Who is it? Show yourself.

148
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,003
Severus, I....

149
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:19,074
You don't want me as your enemy,
Quirrell.

150
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:22,219
- I don't know what you mean.

151
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,308
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

152
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,466
We'll have another little chat soon.

153
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:50,138
When you've had time to decide where
your loyalties lie.

154
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:55,143
Professors. I found this in the
restricted section.

155
00:20:55,144 --> 00:21:02,672
It's still hot. That means there's a
student out of bed.

156
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:36,606
Mum?

157
00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:41,871
Dad?

158
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:17,849
Ron, you've really gotta see this!

159
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,890
Ron, you've gotta see this!

160
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,992
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

161
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:30,020
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

162
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:40,008
Come on! Come! Come look, it's my
parents!

163
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:42,210
I only see us.

164
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:45,780
Look in properly. Go on, stand there.

165
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:49,098
- There. You see them, don't you?

166
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,220
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

167
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:54,756
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

168
00:23:54,757 --> 00:24:00,128
And bloody hell! I'm Quidditch captain
too!

169
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:03,197
I look good.

170
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:07,235
Harry, do you think this mirror shows
the future?

171
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:14,696
How can it? Both my parents are dead.

172
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:39,958
Back again, Harry?

173
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:43,271
I see that you, like many before
you...

174
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:47,775
...have discovered the delights of the
Mirror of Erised.

175
00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:53,281
I trust by now you realize what it
does.

176
00:24:53,282 --> 00:24:56,351
Let me give you a clue.

177
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:58,686
The happiest man on earth...

178
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:02,290
...would look in the mirror and see
only himself...

179
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,826
...exactly as he is.

180
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:10,098
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

181
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:13,835
Yes. And no.

182
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:16,537
It shows us nothing more or less...

183
00:25:16,538 --> 00:25:22,710
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

184
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:27,615
Now you, Harry, who have never known
your family...

185
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:31,719
...you see them standing beside you.

186
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,389
But remember this, Harry.

187
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:40,461
This mirror gives us neither
knowledge...

188
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:43,564
...or truth.

189
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:50,605
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

190
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:54,976
That is why tomorrow, it will be moved
to a new home.

191
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:57,812
And I must ask you...

192
00:25:57,813 --> 00:26:02,483
...not to go looking for it again.

193
00:26:02,484 --> 00:26:06,154
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

194
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:11,556
...and forget to live.

195
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,552
I had you looking in the wrong

196
00:27:06,553 --> 00:27:09,684
section. How could I be so stupid?

197
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:12,987
I checked this out weeks ago for a bit
of light reading.

198
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:17,479
This is light?

199
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:22,330
Of course! Here it is!

200
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:24,382
Nicholas Flamel is the only known

201
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:26,434
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

202
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,302
The what?

203
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:31,506
Honestly, don't you two read?

204
00:27:31,507 --> 00:27:33,401
"The Philosopher's Stone is a

205
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,244
legendary substance with astonishing
powers.

206
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:39,046
It'll transform any metal into pure
gold...

207
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:41,035
...and produces the Elixir of Life

208
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,251
which will make the drinker immortal."

209
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:45,653
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

210
00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:48,589
I know what it means!

211
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,245
"The only Stone currently in existence

212
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:53,561
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

213
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:57,246
...the noted alchemist who last year

214
00:27:57,247 --> 00:28:00,434
celebrated his 665th birthday."

215
00:28:00,435 --> 00:28:02,770
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

216
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:10,004
That's what's under the trap door. The
Philosopher's Stone.

217
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:28,296
Don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no
state to entertain.

218
00:28:28,297 --> 00:28:33,527
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

219
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:38,735
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.

220
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:41,042
- Are you still on about him?

221
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:44,245
We know he's after it. We don't know
why.

222
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:46,153
Snape is one of the teachers

223
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:48,850
protecting the Stone. He won't steal
it.

224
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:49,984
What?

225
00:28:49,985 --> 00:28:53,688
You heard. Come on, I'm a bit
preoccupied today.

226
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:56,424
Wait a minute. "One of the teachers"?

227
00:28:56,425 --> 00:29:00,494
There are other things defending the
Stone, aren't there?

228
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:03,331
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

229
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:06,601
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

230
00:29:06,602 --> 00:29:08,936
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

231
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:12,807
Ain't a soul knows how, except for me
and Dumbledore.

232
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:15,996
I shouldn't have told you that. I

233
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:18,903
should not have told you that.

234
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:35,563
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's....

235
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:37,798
I know what that is!

236
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,768
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

237
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:44,238
I won it. Off a stranger I met down at
the pub.

238
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:50,869
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it, as
a matter of fact.

239
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,601
Is that...

240
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:15,002
...a dragon?

241
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:19,607
That's not just a dragon. That's a
Norwegian Ridgeback.

242
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:22,643
My brother works with these in
Romania.

243
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:28,215
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

244
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:30,351
Hello, Norbert.

245
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:35,323
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

246
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:40,315
Don't you, Norbert?

247
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:50,429
He'll have to be trained up a bit, of
course.

248
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:55,609
Who's that?

249
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,446
Malfoy.

250
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:01,515
Oh, dear.

251
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:04,405
Hagrid always wanted a dragon. Told me

252
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,554
so the first time I met him.

253
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:10,791
It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.

254
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:15,229
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

255
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,857
Good evening.

256
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:24,138
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

257
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:27,908
...gives a student the right to walk
about at night.

258
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:31,094
Therefore, as punishment for your
actions,

259
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:32,947
50 points will be taken.

260
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:36,350
- 50?!
- Each.

261
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:38,919
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

262
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,190
...all four of you will receive
detention.

263
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:46,327
Excuse me, professor, perhaps I heard
you wrong.

264
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:48,929
I thought you said the four of us.

265
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,565
No, you heard me correctly.

266
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:54,565
Honorable as your intentions were, you

267
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:57,104
too were out of bed after hours.

268
00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:02,540
You will join your classmates in
detention.

269
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:15,456
A pity they let the old punishments
die.

270
00:32:15,457 --> 00:32:18,168
Was a time detention found you hanging

271
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,394
by your thumbs in the dungeons.

272
00:32:20,395 --> 00:32:25,728
God, I miss the screaming.

273
00:32:25,801 --> 00:32:29,270
You'll be serving detention with
Hagrid tonight.

274
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:36,710
He's got a little job to do inside the
Dark Forest.

275
00:32:36,711 --> 00:32:41,115
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

276
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:45,144
Good God, you're not still on about

277
00:32:45,145 --> 00:32:48,389
that bloody dragon, are you?

278
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,958
Norbert's gone.

279
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:54,795
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to
live in a colony.

280
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:58,232
That's good, isn't it? He's with his
own kind.

281
00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:00,801
What if he don't like Romania?

282
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:05,673
What if the other dragons are mean to
him? He's only a baby.

283
00:33:05,674 --> 00:33:10,548
For God's sake, pull yourself
together. You're going into the

284
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:11,178
Forest.

285
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,747
Got to have your wits about you.

286
00:33:13,748 --> 00:33:19,820
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

287
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:25,259
Students aren't allowed. And there
are...

288
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,927
...werewolves.

289
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:30,397
There's more than werewolves in those
trees.

290
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,069
You can be sure of that.

291
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,935
Nighty-night.

292
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:44,772
Right. Let's go.

293
00:34:20,115 --> 00:34:22,716
Hagrid, what is that?

294
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:26,554
What we're here for. See that?

295
00:34:26,555 --> 00:34:30,137
That's unicorn blood, that is. I found

296
00:34:30,138 --> 00:34:32,526
one dead a few weeks ago.

297
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:39,589
Now, this one's been hurt bad by
something.

298
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,578
So, it's our job to go and find the
poor beast.

299
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:54,181
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

300
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:58,953
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

301
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:01,188
Okay. Then I get Fang.

302
00:35:01,189 --> 00:35:09,423
Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody
coward.

303
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:13,730
Wait till my father hears about this.

304
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:15,769
This is servant's stuff.

305
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,940
If I didn't know better, I'd say you
were scared.

306
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:23,677
I'm not scared, Potter.

307
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:28,115
Do you hear that?

308
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:29,783
Come on, Fang.

309
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:33,717
Scared!

310
00:35:56,311 --> 00:36:01,006
What is it, Fang?

311
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:12,071
Harry Potter, you must leave. You are

312
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:14,588
known to many creatures here.

313
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:18,826
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

314
00:37:18,827 --> 00:37:21,729
What was that thing you saved me from?

315
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,124
A monstrous creature. It is a terrible

316
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,301
crime to slay a unicorn.

317
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:30,302
Drinking its blood will keep you alive

318
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:33,073
even if you are an inch from death.

319
00:37:33,074 --> 00:37:36,155
But at a terrible price. For you have

320
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:38,345
slain something so pure...

321
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:40,847
...that the moment the blood touches

322
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:43,417
your lips, you will have a half-life.

323
00:37:43,418 --> 00:37:45,452
A cursed life.

324
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:49,590
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

325
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:54,895
Do you mean to say that that thing
that killed the unicorn...

326
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:59,032
...that was drinking its blood, that
was Voldemort?

327
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:05,038
Do you know what is hidden in the
school at this very moment?

328
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,875
The Philosopher's Stone.

329
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:10,444
Harry!

330
00:38:10,445 --> 00:38:15,149
Hello there, Firenze. See you've met
our young Mr. Potter.

331
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,485
You all right there, Harry?

332
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:23,657
Harry Potter, this is where I leave
you.

333
00:38:23,658 --> 00:38:29,992
You're safe now. Good luck.

334
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:39,406
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

335
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:42,443
But he's weak. He's living off the
unicorns.

336
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:45,579
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

337
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,765
Snape doesn't want the Stone for

338
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:50,150
himself. He wants it for Voldemort.

339
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:54,922
With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort
will be strong again.

340
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:56,657
He'll come back.

341
00:38:56,658 --> 00:38:58,659
But if he comes back...

342
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,664
...you don't think he'll try to kill
you, do you?

343
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:07,434
If he'd had the chance, he might have
tried tonight.

344
00:39:07,435 --> 00:39:11,205
And to think I've been worrying about
my Potions final.

345
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:15,175
Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one
thing.

346
00:39:15,176 --> 00:39:20,814
Who's the one wizard Voldemort always
feared?

347
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:23,853
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore is

348
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:26,153
around, Harry, you're safe.

349
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:32,681
As long as Dumbledore is around, you
can't be touched.

350
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:38,653
I'd heard Hogwarts'final exams were

351
00:39:38,654 --> 00:39:41,568
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

352
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:45,472
Speak for yourself. All right there,
Harry?

353
00:39:45,473 --> 00:39:50,844
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

354
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:53,747
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

355
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:59,684
I think it's a warning. It means
danger's coming.

356
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,528
- Of course!
- What is it?

357
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:09,570
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants

358
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:11,498
more than anything is a dragon...

359
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:14,735
...and a stranger just happens to have
one?

360
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:17,671
How many people wander around with
dragon eggs?

361
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:22,436
Why didn't I see it before?

362
00:40:25,513 --> 00:40:29,216
Who gave you the egg? What did he look
like?

363
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:32,185
I never saw his face. He kept his hood
up.

364
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:35,355
You and this stranger must have
talked.

365
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:39,126
He wanted to know what sort of
creatures I looked after.

366
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:43,297
I said, "After Fluffy, a dragon's
gonna be no problem."

367
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:48,201
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

368
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:52,539
How often do you come across a
three-headed dog?

369
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,517
But I told him, "The trick with any

370
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:58,412
beast is to know how to calm him."

371
00:40:58,413 --> 00:41:01,819
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him

372
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,519
music and he falls straight to sleep.

373
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,422
I shouldn't have told you that.

374
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:13,153
Where are you going?

375
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:20,801
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

376
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:23,670
I'm afraid he's not here.

377
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:26,302
He received an urgent owl from the

378
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:28,408
Ministry of Magic and left.

379
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:31,578
He's gone? But this is important!

380
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:35,282
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

381
00:41:35,283 --> 00:41:39,653
- How do you know--?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

382
00:41:39,654 --> 00:41:42,373
I don't know how you know, but I

383
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,093
assure you it is well protected.

384
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:51,893
Now would you go back to your
dormitories? Quietly.

385
00:41:57,672 --> 00:42:00,674
That was no stranger Hagrid met. It
was Snape.

386
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:03,510
Which means he knows how to get past
Fluffy.

387
00:42:03,511 --> 00:42:09,449
- And with Dumbledore gone--
- Good afternoon.

388
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,953
What would three young Gryffindors...

389
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:20,221
...be doing inside on a day like this?

390
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:25,966
- We were just--
- You ought to be careful.

391
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:30,458
People will think you're...

392
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,402
...up to something.

393
00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:47,421
Now what do we do?

394
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:53,722
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

395
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:06,740
Trevor.

396
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:10,410
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

397
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:16,049
Neither should you. You're sneaking
out again, aren't you?

398
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:20,287
- Neville, listen. We were--
- No, I won't let you!

399
00:43:20,288 --> 00:43:25,058
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble
again. I'll fight you.

400
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:33,088
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

401
00:43:37,305 --> 00:43:41,341
You're a little scary sometimes, you
know that?

402
00:43:41,342 --> 00:43:45,612
Brilliant, but scary.

403
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:47,914
Let's go.

404
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:54,681
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

405
00:43:57,592 --> 00:44:04,051
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

406
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:09,924
Alohomora.

407
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,283
Wait a minute. He's...

408
00:44:23,284 --> 00:44:27,547
...snoring.

409
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:35,095
Snape's already been here. He's put a
spell on the harp.

410
00:44:35,096 --> 00:44:40,588
It's got horrible breath.

411
00:44:40,635 --> 00:44:42,936
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

412
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:46,904
Come on!

413
00:44:48,442 --> 00:44:53,001
Okay. Push.

414
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:17,470
I'll go first. Don't follow until I
give you a sign.

415
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:23,310
If something bad happens, get
yourselves out.

416
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:27,480
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

417
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:29,983
The harp.

418
00:45:29,984 --> 00:45:35,180
It's stopped playing.

419
00:45:42,997 --> 00:45:47,226
Jump!

420
00:45:58,045 --> 00:46:04,174
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

421
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:19,399
Stop moving, both of you. This is
Devil's Snare.

422
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,630
You have to relax. If you don't, it

423
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:23,303
will only kill you faster.

424
00:46:23,304 --> 00:46:30,577
Kill us faster? Oh, now I can relax!

425
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:32,445
Hermione!

426
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:36,483
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

427
00:46:36,484 --> 00:46:43,444
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

428
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:51,631
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

429
00:46:51,632 --> 00:46:54,901
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

430
00:46:54,902 --> 00:46:57,604
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

431
00:46:57,605 --> 00:47:01,408
I remember reading something in
Herbology.

432
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:05,478
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. It's
deadly fun...

433
00:47:05,479 --> 00:47:10,116
...but will sulk in the sun! That's
it! It hates sunlight.

434
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:14,676
Lumus Solem.

435
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:25,321
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

436
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:28,768
Lucky we didn't panic.

437
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:33,873
Lucky Hermione pays attention in
Herbology.

438
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:35,608
What is that?

439
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:41,909
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

440
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,129
Curious. I've never seen birds like
these.

441
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,966
They're not birds. They're keys.

442
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:05,925
And I'll bet one of them fits that
door.

443
00:48:06,907 --> 00:48:14,003
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

444
00:48:17,385 --> 00:48:19,819
Strange.

445
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:24,652
Alohomora!

446
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:27,594
Well, it was worth a try.

447
00:48:27,595 --> 00:48:31,031
What will we do? There must be a
thousand keys.

448
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:35,168
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

449
00:48:35,169 --> 00:48:41,036
I see it! The one with the broken
wing.

450
00:48:42,176 --> 00:48:45,378
What's wrong?

451
00:48:45,379 --> 00:48:47,047
It's too simple.

452
00:48:47,048 --> 00:48:50,097
Go on! If Snape could catch it on that

453
00:48:50,098 --> 00:48:52,052
old broomstick, you can.

454
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:58,114
You're the youngest Seeker in a
century.

455
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,966
This complicates things a bit.

456
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:41,425
Catch the key!

457
00:49:43,037 --> 00:49:47,471
Hurry up!

458
00:50:17,438 --> 00:50:22,375
I don't like this. I don't like this
at all.

459
00:50:22,376 --> 00:50:25,879
Where are we? A graveyard.

460
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,008
This is no graveyard.

461
00:50:36,023 --> 00:50:41,458
It's a chessboard.

462
00:50:50,905 --> 00:50:55,339
There's the door.

463
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:06,719
Now what do we do?

464
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,354
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to

465
00:51:09,355 --> 00:51:11,491
play our way across the room.

466
00:51:11,492 --> 00:51:15,595
Harry, you take the empty bishop's
square.

467
00:51:15,596 --> 00:51:19,999
Hermione, you'll be the queen-side
castle.

468
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,596
As for me, I'll be a knight.

469
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:33,713
What happens now?

470
00:51:33,714 --> 00:51:36,950
Well, white moves first.

471
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:40,587
And then...

472
00:51:40,588 --> 00:51:44,350
...we play.

473
00:51:52,399 --> 00:51:57,704
Ron, you don't suppose this is going
to be like...

474
00:51:57,705 --> 00:52:01,674
...real wizard's chess, do you?

475
00:52:01,675 --> 00:52:07,110
You there, D-5.

476
00:52:19,226 --> 00:52:20,994
Yes, Hermione.

477
00:52:20,995 --> 00:52:28,558
I think this is gonna be exactly like
wizard's chess.

478
00:52:31,972 --> 00:52:37,032
Castle to E-4!

479
00:52:38,145 --> 00:52:42,670
Pawn to C-3!

480
00:53:25,092 --> 00:53:29,295
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

481
00:53:29,296 --> 00:53:34,634
Once I make my move, the queen will
take me.

482
00:53:34,635 --> 00:53:37,236
Then you're free to check the king.

483
00:53:37,237 --> 00:53:40,573
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

484
00:53:40,574 --> 00:53:43,081
- He's going to sacrifice himself.

485
00:53:43,082 --> 00:53:45,445
- No, there must be another way!

486
00:53:45,446 --> 00:53:49,349
Do you wanna stop Snape from getting
that Stone or not?

487
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:53,453
Harry, it's you that has to go on. I
know it.

488
00:53:53,454 --> 00:53:58,752
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

489
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,935
Knight to H-3.

490
00:54:30,324 --> 00:54:34,815
Check.

491
00:55:01,488 --> 00:55:03,489
Ron!

492
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:11,826
No, don't move! Don't forget, we're
still playing.

493
00:55:24,311 --> 00:55:28,142
Checkmate.

494
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,267
Take care of Ron. Then go to the
owlery.

495
00:55:48,268 --> 00:55:52,338
Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's
right.

496
00:55:52,339 --> 00:55:54,774
I have to go on.

497
00:55:54,775 --> 00:56:00,880
You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great
wizard. You really are.

498
00:56:00,881 --> 00:56:04,250
Not as good as you.

499
00:56:04,251 --> 00:56:10,256
Me? Books and cleverness. There are
more important things.

500
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:18,423
Friendship and bravery. And, Harry,
just be careful.

501
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:56,469
You?

502
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:00,473
No, it can't be. Snape, he was the--

503
00:57:00,474 --> 00:57:03,776
Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't
he?

504
00:57:03,777 --> 00:57:07,079
Next to him, who would suspect...

505
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,217
...poor, stuttering Professor
Quirrell?

506
00:57:11,218 --> 00:57:14,172
But that day, during the Quidditch

507
00:57:14,173 --> 00:57:16,789
match, Snape tried to kill me.

508
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:20,126
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

509
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,528
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire

510
00:57:22,529 --> 00:57:24,463
and broken my eye contact...

511
00:57:24,464 --> 00:57:26,899
...I would have succeeded.

512
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,136
Even with Snape muttering his
counter-curse.

513
00:57:30,137 --> 00:57:32,505
Snape was trying to save me?

514
00:57:32,506 --> 00:57:38,077
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

515
00:57:38,078 --> 00:57:42,548
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

516
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:46,118
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

517
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:49,285
While everyone ran about, he went to

518
00:57:49,286 --> 00:57:52,024
the third floor to head me off.

519
00:57:52,025 --> 00:57:56,495
He, of course, never trusted me again.

520
00:57:56,496 --> 00:58:01,968
He rarely left me alone. But he
doesn't understand.

521
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:06,238
I'm never alone. Never.

522
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:11,877
Now, what does this mirror do?

523
00:58:11,878 --> 00:58:14,580
I see what I desire.

524
00:58:14,581 --> 00:58:19,185
I see myself holding the Stone. But
how do I get it?

525
00:58:19,186 --> 00:58:22,154
Use the boy.

526
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:28,591
Come here, Potter! Now!

527
00:58:38,138 --> 00:58:44,631
Tell me, what do you see?

528
00:59:07,334 --> 00:59:09,969
What is it? What do you see?

529
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:15,341
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

530
00:59:15,342 --> 00:59:17,376
He lies.

531
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:21,280
Tell the truth! What do you see?

532
00:59:21,281 --> 00:59:25,885
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

533
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:32,447
I have strength enough for this.

534
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:51,177
Harry Potter...

535
00:59:51,178 --> 00:59:53,779
...we meet again.

536
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,381
Voldemort.

537
00:59:55,382 --> 00:59:59,618
Yes. You see what I've become?

538
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:03,389
See what I must do to survive?

539
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:08,194
Live off another. A mere parasite.

540
01:00:08,195 --> 01:00:11,731
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

541
01:00:11,732 --> 01:00:15,601
...but it cannot give me a body of my
own.

542
01:00:15,602 --> 01:00:19,371
But there is something that can.

543
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:25,311
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

544
01:00:25,312 --> 01:00:29,473
Stop him!

545
01:00:31,952 --> 01:00:35,221
Don't be a fool.

546
01:00:35,222 --> 01:00:38,591
Why suffer an horrific death...

547
01:00:38,592 --> 01:00:42,428
...when you can join me and live?

548
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:45,531
Never!

549
01:00:45,532 --> 01:00:51,070
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

550
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:54,573
Tell me, Harry...

551
01:00:54,574 --> 01:00:58,711
...would you like to see your mother
and father again?

552
01:00:58,712 --> 01:01:00,980
Together...

553
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:03,949
...we can bring them back.

554
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:11,149
All I ask is for something in return.

555
01:01:15,428 --> 01:01:19,431
That's it, Harry.

556
01:01:19,432 --> 01:01:23,536
There is no good and evil.

557
01:01:23,537 --> 01:01:26,739
There is only power...

558
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:31,544
...and those too weak to seek it.

559
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:36,982
Together, we'll do extraordinary
things.

560
01:01:36,983 --> 01:01:41,747
Just give me the Stone!

561
01:01:41,822 --> 01:01:43,255
You liar!

562
01:01:43,256 --> 01:01:47,883
Kill him!

563
01:02:08,915 --> 01:02:16,751
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

564
01:03:59,459 --> 01:04:04,129
Good afternoon, Harry.

565
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:08,801
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

566
01:04:08,802 --> 01:04:11,841
What happened in the dungeons between

567
01:04:11,842 --> 01:04:15,040
you and Professor Quirrell is a
secret.

568
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:22,147
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

569
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:26,051
I see that your friend Ronald has
saved you the trouble...

570
01:04:26,052 --> 01:04:29,088
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

571
01:04:29,089 --> 01:04:32,291
Ron was here? Is he all right? What
about Hermione?

572
01:04:32,292 --> 01:04:37,730
Fine. They're both just fine.

573
01:04:37,731 --> 01:04:40,833
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

574
01:04:40,834 --> 01:04:44,169
The Stone has been destroyed.

575
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:48,374
My friend Nicholas and I have had a
little chat...

576
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:52,578
...and agreed it was best all around.

577
01:04:52,579 --> 01:04:58,450
But then, Flamel, he'll die, won't he?

578
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:04,123
He has enough Elixir to set his
affairs in order.

579
01:05:04,124 --> 01:05:07,593
But yes, he will die.

580
01:05:07,594 --> 01:05:10,195
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

581
01:05:10,196 --> 01:05:12,998
One minute I was staring in the mirror
and--

582
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:17,336
You see, only a person...

583
01:05:17,337 --> 01:05:21,507
...who wanted to find the Stone, find
it...

584
01:05:21,508 --> 01:05:27,046
...but not use it, would be able to
get it.

585
01:05:27,047 --> 01:05:30,783
That is one of my more brilliant
ideas.

586
01:05:30,784 --> 01:05:37,222
And between you and me, that is saying
something.

587
01:05:37,223 --> 01:05:39,995
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,

588
01:05:39,996 --> 01:05:42,694
that Voldemort can never come back?

589
01:05:42,695 --> 01:05:46,432
I'm afraid...

590
01:05:46,433 --> 01:05:51,203
...there are ways in which he can
return.

591
01:05:51,204 --> 01:05:53,972
Harry, do you know why...

592
01:05:53,973 --> 01:05:58,177
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to
have you touch him?

593
01:05:58,178 --> 01:06:01,050
It was because of your mother. She

594
01:06:01,051 --> 01:06:03,348
sacrificed herself for you.

595
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:06,819
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

596
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:10,756
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

597
01:06:10,757 --> 01:06:16,562
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

598
01:06:16,563 --> 01:06:22,760
Love, Harry. Love.

599
01:06:28,308 --> 01:06:32,711
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

600
01:06:32,712 --> 01:06:35,282
I was most unfortunate in my youth to

601
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,583
come across a vomit-flavored one.

602
01:06:37,584 --> 01:06:41,120
And since then, I've lost my liking
for them.

603
01:06:41,121 --> 01:06:44,723
But I think I could be safe...

604
01:06:44,724 --> 01:06:49,556
...with a nice toffee.

605
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:53,398
Alas!

606
01:06:53,399 --> 01:06:57,992
Earwax.

607
01:07:10,783 --> 01:07:15,087
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

608
01:07:15,088 --> 01:07:18,457
All right. Hermione?

609
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:22,789
Never better.

610
01:07:36,075 --> 01:07:39,311
Another year gone.

611
01:07:39,312 --> 01:07:44,082
And now, as I understand it, the house
cup needs awarding.

612
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,919
And the points stand thus:

613
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:54,660
In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312
points.

614
01:07:54,661 --> 01:08:02,793
Third place, Hufflepuff with 352
points.

615
01:08:05,572 --> 01:08:07,606
In second place...

616
01:08:07,607 --> 01:08:14,908
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

617
01:08:18,117 --> 01:08:20,152
And in first place...

618
01:08:20,153 --> 01:08:28,057
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

619
01:08:31,164 --> 01:08:35,825
Nice one, mate.

620
01:08:37,203 --> 01:08:41,540
Yes, well done, Slytherin. Well done.

621
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:46,044
However, recent events must be taken
into account.

622
01:08:46,045 --> 01:08:51,650
And I have a few last-minute points to
award.

623
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:57,322
To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool
use of intellect...

624
01:08:57,323 --> 01:09:00,859
...while others were in grave peril...

625
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:04,029
...50 points.

626
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:07,827
Good job.

627
01:09:13,006 --> 01:09:16,775
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the

628
01:09:16,776 --> 01:09:19,578
best-played game of chess...

629
01:09:19,579 --> 01:09:27,346
...that Hogwarts has seen these many
years, 50 points.

630
01:09:29,455 --> 01:09:32,057
And third...

631
01:09:32,058 --> 01:09:35,093
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

632
01:09:35,094 --> 01:09:39,998
...for pure nerve and outstanding
courage...

633
01:09:39,999 --> 01:09:47,402
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

634
01:09:53,212 --> 01:09:55,314
We're tied with Slytherin!

635
01:09:55,315 --> 01:09:58,220
Finally, it takes a great deal of

636
01:09:58,221 --> 01:10:01,553
bravery to stand up to your enemies...

637
01:10:01,554 --> 01:10:05,624
...but a great deal more to stand up
to your friends.

638
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:08,794
I award 10 points...

639
01:10:08,795 --> 01:10:14,492
...to Neville Longbottom.

640
01:10:25,345 --> 01:10:28,980
Assuming that my calculations are
correct...

641
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:36,009
...I believe that a change of
decoration is in order.

642
01:10:38,524 --> 01:10:44,391
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

643
01:11:19,999 --> 01:11:23,535
Come on, now. Hurry up, you'll be
late.

644
01:11:23,536 --> 01:11:30,268
Train's leaving. Go on. Come on, hurry
up.

645
01:11:33,246 --> 01:11:39,045
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

646
01:11:42,822 --> 01:11:49,019
Thought you were leaving without
saying goodbye, did you?

647
01:11:49,896 --> 01:11:54,091
This is for you.

648
01:12:08,347 --> 01:12:12,940
Thanks, Hagrid.

649
01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:21,159
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

650
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,637
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,

651
01:12:23,638 --> 01:12:25,831
Dudley, gives you any grief...

652
01:12:25,832 --> 01:12:28,767
...you could always threaten him...

653
01:12:28,768 --> 01:12:31,870
...with a nice pair of ears to go with
his tail.

654
01:12:31,871 --> 01:12:34,963
But we're not allowed to do magic away

655
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:37,342
from Hogwarts. You know that.

656
01:12:37,343 --> 01:12:44,212
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

657
01:12:47,253 --> 01:12:50,589
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

658
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:52,891
I'm not going home.

659
01:12:52,892 --> 01:12:57,292
Not really.
